								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>From birth, I discovered the passion to use my brain in a way where I can make earth a better place using life skills such as problem solving, communicating, programming and more. From a young age I had a passion to create, and create with code. Today, I am able to program in 5+ Programming Languages including Html, Javascript, Python, C#, C++ and continue to learn everyday!</p>
								<p>Apart from Programming, I have many other hobbies including my love for basketball. Basketball has been a sport i have been able to fall in love with through the amount of oppurtunity to play as a child. Throughout my childhood, Basketball was a sport I would play in my free time. I also have the passion to challenge myself with dificult math problems. I am able to challenge myself every so often with a new math problem, looking for an answer. Since a young age, Math has always been a favourite subject of mine as I was able to see it as a way to grow my knowledge. Math and Basketball have been two big hobbies of mine, but I will always support my favourite sport teams. My favourite sport teams include the 2019 NBA Champions, Toronto Raptors, Arsenal from the Premier League and my love for the Washington Capitals in the NHL.</p>
