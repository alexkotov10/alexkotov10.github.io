								<h2>What is an Introvert?</h2>
								<p>An Introvert tends to have a lot of different traits to an Extrovert and in most cases are much different than an Extrovert</p>
								<p>Introverts tend to need a quiet environment to concentrate and in general like these quite environments when they are alone. Introverts also tend to be very reflective and self aware on things they do. Introverts usually think before they speak. If Introverts have a chance to work alone or in a group for the most part they would choose to work alone. Introverts also tend to have a few close friends, than many friends.</p>
								<p>There are many different types of introverts such as Social Introverts who like small groups, Thinking Introverts who have a lot of imagination, Anxious Introverts who are mainly introverted because they feel shy and restrained introverts who think before they act</p>
								<h2>What is an Extrovert?</h2>
								<p>An Extrovert is almost on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to an Introvert. An Extrovert feels more comfortable being social and likes big crowds and speaking in big group conversations. Extroverts are much more outgoing and comfortable speaking with new people. However because of them being outgoing they can easily get distracted while doing work. Extroverts also tend to be optimistic and sometimes risk takers. Extroverts tend to like having many friends and dislike alone time. Extroverts are also fine with expressing their own problems with people while introverts might not want to</p>

								<h2>Am I an Introvert or Extrovert?</h2>
								<p>Personally I believe I have many traits from both an Introvert and Extrovert but I believe I am slightly more of an Extrovert</p>
								<p>I have many traits similar to an Extrovert, I would consider myself outgoing and in general being with groups of my friends and people. I would also consider myself very optimistic.</p>
								<p>The reasons I think I also have traits for Introvert is because I don’t like sharing my problems with others and like to keep it to myself. I also don’t dislike alone time like some extroverts do, but I much prefer being with people than alone.</p>
								<p>The Results of a Introvert/Extrovert test also said I am 68% Extroverted which makes sense to me as I think there is parts of me that has Introverted traits.</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>My Most Dominant Big 5 Personality traits</h2>
								<p>★★★★★ Emotional Stability: I think this trait best represents me as I am someone who is able to work even when going through stresses in life. A person with this trait is also mentally stable which I think I am. It is hard for me to get upset which further proves why i think this trait fits me best</p>
								<p>★★★★☆ Agreeableness: I think this is the second best trait that represents me because I am a cooperative person and enjoy working in team environments. I would also consider me to be optimistic which makes this trait fit me as well.</p>
								<p>★★★★☆ Extraversion: This trait applies to me but not as great as Agreeableness and Emotional Stability. The Test I took did say I was an Extrovert however and for the most part I agree, I enjoy being around people and like large groups and in general think I am an outgoing person. </p>
								<p>★★★☆☆ Conscientiousness: This Trait applies to me but the other 3 traits i mentioned apply to me more. I Do agree that I like to be organized and think before I speak, but a lot of traits such as being known as a workaholic sometimes are things I would not agree with personally.</p>
								<p>★☆☆☆☆ Openness to Experience: This Trait does not really apply to me. Sometimes I am open to trying new things, but for the most part I stick with the things I already do. Things such as Trying new foods I am fine with, but other then that i wouldnt say im open to new things. </p>

								<h2>My Myers-Briggs Personality Type</h2>
								<p>The Personality type I got through the Myers-Briggs Personality Type test is ESTJ-A. People with this personality type are extroverted and also dedicated, which applies to me. people with this trait also tend to be honest which would be a good trait for many careers. Some Careers that fit this personality type include jobs relating to finance such as office manager and real estate agent. There are also some careers such as Mechanical Engineer, Civil Engineer and Physician which are careers that fit this personality type. Personally the only careers of the ones I mentioned I could see me in are Mechanical engineering and Civil Engineering as in general I like creating and designing. In General however, I do agree that other people with my trait could be in these types of careers since most of these careers are in business. In Business careers you need to be an extrovert to sell a point to a client and in general be very friendly. It is also important to be honest in business, you do not want to lie to a client as that can ruin repitation. </p>

								<h2>Personality Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
								<p>My Personality ESTJ-A has many different Strengths. A Strength my personality trait has is being dedicated. This means the person is highly devoted to goals they set for themselves and they have the dedication to finish them. They will spend the time and effort to finish these goals, even if they are team-based or individual. People with this trait are also Honest. They won’t lie to you and instead tell the truth even though sometimes it might be too brutally honest. People with my trait are also strong-willed and defend the ideas they might have. It’s very difficult for them to switch ideas. Along with those three main strengths, people with my personality trait also tend to be Loyal, Organized and Optimistic.</p>
								<p>However, My Personality ESTJ-A also has a few different weaknesses. People with my personality trait tend to be very stubborn. This means that even if a better idea is brought up, it might be hard for a person like me or a person with my trait to change decisions even if it means changing to a better idea. People with my trait are also judgemental. We tend to dismiss that there can be multiple correct answers but instead, we sometimes criticize if someone has a different opinion to ours. People with my trait also have issues expressing emotion. This can be both positive and negative emotion. For example, if we have something wrong going on in our lives it might be hard to open up about their challenges. On the other side, it might be difficult to express emotion when someone else does a task that would make you happy. Along with these three main weaknesses, people with my trait can also have weaknesses such as caring too much about their social status, having a hard time relaxing and having difficulty being in uncomfortable situations.</p>
								<p>For the most part, Some of these Strengths such as being dedicated, honest and Optimistic apply to me. There are also many strengths that can apply to me such as being too judgemental, stubborn and difficult to express emotions when it's negative at times.</p>

								<h2>Why is Personality important in the workplace?</h2>
								<p>Personality is very important in the workplace. If you understand your co-worker's personality types, you will be able to collaborate with each other since you can work off their weaknesses and vice versa. Personality can also affect work performance. There are several types of Personalities, whether from the big 5 or Myers-Briggs personality traits that work more efficiently than others. It is important to know what personalities your co-workers have as it can help you know their work style when collaborating. As a manager or supervisor, It is important to know your employee's personality types. If you want to put your employees in groups to collaborate, you don’t want to put 5 people with the same personality in a group, or 5 people who are all leaders in a group, it is best to split them up. If you know your employee's personalities, you can get to know them better and the manager can work differently with employees with different personality types.</p>
